bidAmount cannot bre greater than actual coupon amount

for user account linking is compulsory to upload coupon

problem 1: most of the coupon gets wasted as we dont need to shop or we spend extra penny to use coupon
    user can also generate 2nd source of income by arranging coupons
    
  2: incase of emergencies we are not able to attend some meeting or event and our ticket gets wasted 
    (amount cannot exceed ticket amount) - (can sell only 1 or ticket from one account)

soln: 1. we will build a platform where user can upload their voucher/ticket and get paid for it. 
  (both user and consumer gets some benefit)
  (hamare hindi m ek kahawat h. kuch nhi s kuch to acha)

tackle frauds: 
  1. check for apis to validate coupon and mark it as verified
  2. apply coupon to the companies website or app and attach a ss for it our team will validate it and mark it as verified
  
  3. if payment is completed user will receive notification for coupon code
    if coupon code is not valid than user should upload a screen shot of coupon invalid and can ask for refund within 3 hours. 
    our team will verify and initate refund
    owner can initate payment transfer only after 6 hours of coupon purchase
